# Train Schedule using a Firebase Database

I used Google Firebase to create a database to which user data is saved. Data living on my Firebase database is displayed on the page.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - A Twitter CSS library.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
* [AJAX](http://www.adaptivepath.org/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/) - Asynchronous JavaScript + XML.
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - A high-level, interpreted programming language.
* [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - A mobile and web application development platform.
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - A JavaScript library that can parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times.

## Getting Started

Please enjoy a placid pond of Koi fish. Aren't they lovely? Very good.

Please enter some information about your fictional or non-fictional train line. You will enter the name of the train, the name of the train's destination, the first time of departure of this train, and finally, you will enter the frequency at which this train stops to collect passengers.

## Highlights

* It works...
* Those awesome Koi fish. (https://codepen.io/K-T/pen/Ldgdab)
* App is mostly mobile responsive.

## License

Take it. Use it. Tell the people.
